# STM32 Snake Game with MAX7219 & Bluetooth Control

## Introduction
This project runs a classic Snake Game application on an 8x8 LED dot matrix driven by a MAX7219 display driver, running on an STM32 Nucleo-F302R8 development board. The game can be played using Bluetooth control via an HC-06 module, and real-time direction input can be made from a smartphone.
